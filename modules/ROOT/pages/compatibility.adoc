= Compatibility Guide


Quarkus Couchbase needs Quarkus 3.15 or newer.

See the xref:java-sdk:project-docs:compatibility.adoc[Java SDK Compatibility Guide] for wider compatibility of the Java SDK --
but note that Quarkus Couchbase needs at least JDK 17.

We'd recommend using SDKMAN to manage versions of JVM and associated tools.
