The Couchbase Quarkus extension integrates the Couchbase Java SDK within the Quarkus ecosystem.
Most notably this extension provides GraalVM native-image support to the existing Java SDK, in addition to other Quarkus integration such as Health Checks, ArC dependency injection, Micrometer metrics, DevServices and more.


== Key Features

* *Dependency Injection*: Easily inject a Couchbase `Cluster` into your application using Quarkus' CDI.
* *Simplified Configuration*: Manage Couchbase connection and cluster settings through `application.properties`.
* *Native-Image Support*: Compatible with GraalVM/Mandrel for building native images.
* *Couchbase Operations*: Support for KV, Query, Transactions, Analytics, Search, and Management operations.
* *Micrometer Metrics*: Integrates with `quarkus-micrometer`.
* *Health Checks*: Provides a readiness check via `quarkus-smallrye-health`.
* *Dev Services*: Simplifies local development with automatic startup of a Couchbase TestContainer.


== Current Limitations

* *TLS Configuration*: While connections to Couchbase Capella are supported by default using the `couchbases://` scheme in dev mode, custom certificates or trust store configurations are not yet exposed.
* *OpenTelemetry Tracing*: The `tracing-opentelemetry` package for the Couchbase Java SDK is not currently supported.
* *Exhaustive Cluster configuration*: Cluster configurations via `application.properties` are limited to those listed below.
